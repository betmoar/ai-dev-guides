### **How to Populate the Task and Implementation Plan**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Define Frontend Tasks**
   - Break down UI requirements into specific components.
   - Example:
     - Component: Navbar
       - Task: Create a responsive navbar with dropdowns.
       - AI Prompt: *"Generate a React component for a responsive navbar using Tailwind CSS with dropdown functionality."*

2. **Define Backend Tasks**
   - Outline APIs, server logic, and database models.
   - Example:
     - API Endpoint: `/widgets`
       - Task: Create an API for fetching widget data.
       - AI Prompt: *"Write a Bun server route for fetching widget data from an SQLite database."*

3. **Document AI Integration**
   - Specify tools and their usage.
   - Example:
     - GitHub Copilot: For generating reusable frontend components.
     - OpenAI: For writing and explaining backend logic.
     - Validation: *"Review AI-generated code for potential security vulnerabilities."*

4. **Create a Testing Plan**
   - Define test cases for each task.
   - Example:
     - Unit Test: Verify API response formats.
       - AI Prompt: *"Generate Jest tests for verifying the `/widgets` API response."*

5. **Draft Execution Workflows**
   - Outline the steps for completing tasks.
   - Example Workflow for Frontend Component:
     1. **Identify**: Define the component requirements.
     2. **Analyze**: Break down the component into props, styles, and states.
     3. **Code Changes**: Use Copilot to scaffold the initial component.
     4. **Code Implementation**: Refactor and integrate the generated code.
     5. **Testing**: Run tests and validate the component.
