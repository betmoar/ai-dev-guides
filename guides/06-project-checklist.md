The **"Project Checklist for AI-Driven Development"** would fit as a **supplementary guide** that spans **across all stages** of the workflow, acting as a practical tool to track progress and ensure completion of tasks. Here's how it aligns with each document:

---

### **Positioning Between Documents**

1. **Product Specification Document (PSD):**
   - The checklist serves as a **validation tool** to confirm that project goals, features, and AI plans outlined in the PSD are properly executed.
   - Example: "Has the PSD been reviewed and approved? Are features prioritized with clear success criteria?"

2. **Technical Blueprint:**
   - The checklist helps verify that all technical requirements and workflows in the blueprint are implemented.
   - Example: "Are architecture diagrams completed? Have frameworks and AI roles been identified?"

3. **Task and Implementation Plan:**
   - The checklist ensures that each task is **broken down, assigned, and tracked**.
   - Example: "Are frontend tasks for Component X completed? Is the AI integration for API Y validated?"

4. **Code Review and Change Log:**
   - Tracks code reviews and change documentation in real-time.
   - Example: "Has the AI-generated code been reviewed for bugs? Has every change been logged in the Change Log?"

5. **Release and Deployment Guide:**
   - Ensures pre-deployment and post-deployment steps are followed systematically.
   - Example: "Was the pre-deployment checklist completed? Were all live features smoke-tested?"

### **Checklist’s Role in the Workflow**

- **Central Tracking Tool:** Serves as a bridge across documents to confirm that high-level plans are realized through tangible progress.
- **Accountability:** Offers a clear structure to sign off on tasks and milestones, ensuring nothing is overlooked.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Dynamic updates to reflect project status across documents and workflows.

### **Benefits**
1. **Complements Documents:** The checklist ties together the high-level intent of documents (e.g., PSD) with granular, actionable steps.
2. **Dynamic Application:** It’s updated as tasks progress, while documents remain static records.
3. **Improved Usability:** Makes the process easier for teams or individuals to track what’s completed and what’s pending.
