### **Populating and Using Project Files**

This guide explains how to populate each project file, its purpose, and how it fits into the development process. Follow these steps to ensure your files are well-organized and contribute effectively to your project's success.

---

#### **1. Product Specification Document (PSD)**

##### **Purpose**  
Defines the project scope, objectives, and high-level features. It helps align stakeholders and AI tools by providing clear requirements.

##### **How to Populate**
1. **Project Overview:**
   - Define the name and describe the project (e.g., "A dashboard template with modular widgets").
2. **Goals:**
   - Specify the main objectives and success criteria.
3. **Features:**
   - List each feature in detail with priority and any AI-specific roles (e.g., Copilot for UI design, OpenAI for API endpoints).
4. **AI Assistance Plan:**
   - Outline how AI tools will be used (e.g., prompt styles, iterative workflows).
5. **Risks & Mitigation:**
   - Identify challenges (e.g., AI misunderstanding prompts) and propose solutions (e.g., clear communication, manual review).

##### **Usage**
- Share with team members and use it as a reference to align tasks with project goals.
- Attach to AI tools like Claude to guide planning and feature scoping.

#### **2. Technical Blueprint**

##### **Purpose**  
Provides a detailed technical foundation, ensuring consistency in architecture and guiding AI contributions during development.

##### **How to Populate**
1. **System Overview:**
   - Include architecture diagrams, specifying where AI tools will contribute (e.g., Copilot for frontend components).
2. **Component Breakdown:**
   - List major components (e.g., widget system, authentication) and their dependencies.
3. **AI Workflow:**
   - Define workflows for tasks like debugging or component generation (e.g., prompt examples for each task).
4. **Deployment Plan:**
   - Outline deployment strategies, tools, and environments (e.g., Vercel for hosting).

##### **Usage**
- Use as a roadmap for developers and AI systems to maintain alignment.
- Refer to it during code reviews and testing to validate architectural adherence.

#### **3. Task and Implementation Plan**

##### **Purpose**  
Breaks the project into actionable steps, specifying how to involve AI for maximum efficiency.

##### **How to Populate**
1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Detail each UI component and specify prompts for Copilot.
2. **Backend Development:**
   - List API endpoints, data models, and logic implementation with prompt examples.
3. **Testing Plan:**
   - Define unit and integration test cases, and identify where AI can generate tests.
4. **Steps for Execution:**
   - Include these for each task:
     - Identify: Define the task.
     - Analyze: Break it into components.
     - Code Changes: Use AI tools for scaffolding or refactoring.
     - Implementation: Integrate into the codebase.
     - Testing: Validate with test cases.

##### **Usage**
- Use for task tracking and ensuring AI-generated work aligns with requirements.
- Sign off each step as it’s completed to monitor progress.

---

#### **4. Code Review and Change Log**

##### **Purpose**  
Tracks changes and ensures every AI-generated contribution is validated and documented.

##### **How to Populate**
1. **Version Information:**
   - Record version number, date, and contributors.
2. **Changes:**
   - Document AI contributions (e.g., “Generated API endpoint using OpenAI”).
3. **Testing Summary:**
   - Record unit and integration test results.
4. **Issues:**
   - Log bugs and fixes for future reference.

##### **Usage**
- Use as a reference for debugging and troubleshooting.
- Share with team members for collaborative reviews.

---

#### **5. Release and Deployment Guide**

##### **Purpose**  
Outlines the steps for building, deploying, and validating the application in production.

##### **How to Populate**
1. **Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
   - Include linting, tests, and environment setup.
2. **Build and Deploy:**
   - Specify build commands (e.g., `vite build`) and deployment tools (e.g., Vercel).
3. **Post-Deployment Testing:**
   - Define smoke and functional tests for live environments.
4. **Bug Reporting:**
   - Include guidelines for identifying and fixing bugs in production.

##### **Usage**
- Use during the deployment process to ensure all tasks are completed systematically.
- Share with operations or QA teams for testing.

### **Best Practices**

1. **Use AI to Populate Files:**
   - Prompt Claude or OpenAI to draft sections based on initial requirements. Example: 
     - *Prompt*: "List risks and mitigation strategies for a React dashboard using Vite and Tailwind CSS."
2. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Use AI tools to expand and refine content as the project progresses.
3. **Validation and Review:**
   - Manually review all AI contributions to ensure accuracy and quality.
4. **Use a Checklist for Consistency:**
   - Sign off tasks in the Task and Implementation Plan to track progress.

### **Example Task for AI Execution**

#### **Task: Create a Modular Widget System**

1. **Identify:**
   - Purpose: Develop configurable widgets for the dashboard.
   - Details: Widgets should support resizing and dynamic data updates.

2. **Analyze:**
   - Use ShadCN UI for base components.
   - Backend API in Bun for widget data.

3. **Code Changes:**
   - Prompt Copilot: *“Create a React component for a resizable widget using Tailwind CSS.”*
   - Use OpenAI: *“Generate a Bun API endpoint for retrieving widget data.”*

4. **Implementation:**
   - Integrate the React component with backend data calls.

5. **Testing:**
   - Run Jest tests for widget rendering.
   - Validate API response with mock data.
