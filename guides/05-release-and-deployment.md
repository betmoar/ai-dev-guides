### **Guide for the Code Review and Change Log**

The **Code Review and Change Log** document tracks changes in the codebase, ensures AI-generated code is thoroughly reviewed, and validates the functionality of implemented features. This document combines detailed version tracking with a standardized review process to maintain code quality and project transparency.

### **How to Populate the Code Review and Change Log**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Record Version Information**
   - Assign version numbers for each release or major change.
   - Example:
     - Version: `0.1.0`
     - Date: `2024-11-15`
     - Author(s): Jane Doe
     - Summary: *"Added Navbar Component and API integration for widgets."*

2. **Summarize Changes**
   - Describe what was added, removed, or modified.
   - Highlight AI contributions.
   - Example:
     - *"Used GitHub Copilot to generate Navbar component; manually optimized responsiveness."*

3. **Document Code Reviews**
   - Include feedback and fixes.
   - Example Review Checklist:
