### **Guide for the Technical Blueprint**

The **Technical Blueprint** is a critical document that outlines the system's architecture, technical details, and workflows, focusing on how AI tools like GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, and Claude will assist in development. This document bridges the conceptual goals from the PSD with the practical implementation in the Task and Implementation Plan.

### **How to Populate the Technical Blueprint**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Define the System Overview**
   - Use a diagramming tool (Lucidchart, Draw.io, or Mermaid.js) to map the architecture.
   - Example:
     - Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (modular components).
     - Backend: Bun server for API logic.
     - Database: SQLite for lightweight storage.

2. **Break Down Components**
   - List components and their responsibilities.
   - Example:
     - Widget System: Handles widget rendering and configuration.
     - Authentication: Role-based access control.
   - Assign AI tools for relevant tasks:
     - GitHub Copilot for frontend components.
     - OpenAI for backend API scaffolding.

3. **Document AI Workflows**
   - Specify prompts for each task and validation steps.
   - Example Prompt:
     - *"Generate a React component for a resizable widget using Tailwind CSS with a drag-and-drop feature."*
   - Validation:
     - *"Review the generated code for reusability and security vulnerabilities."*

4. **Choose Frameworks and Tools**
   - Justify the selection of frameworks.
   - Example:
     - Vite: "Chosen for its fast build times and modern JavaScript features."
     - ShadCN UI: "Provides consistent and customizable UI components."

5. **Draft the Deployment Plan**
   - Describe the hosting and deployment strategy.
   - Example:
     - Frontend on Vercel.
     - Backend deployed using Bun’s native HTTP server.
     - CI/CD pipeline for automated builds.
