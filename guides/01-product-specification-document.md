### **Guide for the Product Specification Document (PSD)**

The **Product Specification Document (PSD)** is a foundational document that defines the project scope, goals, features, and the role of AI tools in achieving them. It provides a high-level overview to guide the development process while ensuring alignment between team members and the AI-driven workflow.

---

### **Purpose of the PSD**
- **Define the Vision**: Establish what the project aims to achieve.
- **Align Goals**: Ensure that stakeholders, developers, and AI tools are working toward the same objectives.
- **Provide Context**: Offer detailed information for AI tools like OpenAI, Claude, and GitHub Copilot to generate meaningful outputs.
- **Track Scope**: Set boundaries to prevent scope creep by clearly defining the minimum viable product (MVP).

### **How to Populate the PSD**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**
1. **Brainstorm the Vision**:
   - Involve stakeholders or use Claude to refine the idea.
   - Example Prompt: *"Help me write a brief description for a React-based dashboard application targeting project managers."*

2. **Define the Goals**:
   - Be specific and measurable.
   - Example: *"The app should support drag-and-drop widgets with live data updates."*

3. **List Features**:
   - Use AI to break down the app into core functionalities.
   - Example Prompt: *"List key features for a modular dashboard, prioritized for an MVP."*

4. **Draft the AI Assistance Plan**:
   - Map tasks to tools like GitHub Copilot or OpenAI.
   - Example Prompt: *"Suggest how to use GitHub Copilot to create a responsive navbar in React with Tailwind CSS."*

5. **Identify Risks and Mitigation**:
   - Discuss potential pitfalls with the team or AI.
   - Example: *"What risks might arise when deploying a Chrome extension built with AI-generated code?"*

### **Example PSD**

```markdown
# Product Specification Document (PSD)

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Modular Dashboard
- **Description:** A responsive, customizable dashboard app for project managers using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI.

## Goals
- **Primary Objective:** Build an MVP with drag-and-drop widgets and real-time data.
- **Success Criteria:** 
  1. 90% of end-users can customize their dashboard without errors.
  2. Load times under 1 second for widgets.

## Features
1. **Core Features**:
   - Widget resizing and drag-and-drop functionality (High Priority).
   - Authentication and role-based access (Medium Priority).
2. **Future Features**:
   - Real-time collaboration (Low Priority).

## AI Assistance Plan
- **Frontend Tasks:** Use GitHub Copilot to scaffold React components and integrate Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend Tasks:** Use OpenAI for generating Bun API endpoints.
- **Testing:** Ask Claude to review test case coverage.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk 1:** AI-generated code may have security vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation:** Conduct manual code reviews and security testing.
- **Risk 2:** Feature scope creep.
  - **Mitigation:** Freeze the MVP scope during initial development.
